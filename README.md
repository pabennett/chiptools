**ChipTools** is a utility to automate FPGA build and verification

[![Smoke](https://github.com/sarnold/chiptools/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sarnold/chiptools/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## What can it do?

ChipTools aims to simplify the process of building and testing FPGA designs by
providing a consistent interface to vendor applications and automating simulation and synthesis flows.

### Key features

   * Seamlessly switch between vendor applications without modifying build scripts or project files.
   * Enhance testbenches with Python based stimulus generation and checking.
   * Automate test execution and reporting using the Python Unittest framework.
   * Automatically check and archive build outputs.
   * Preprocess and update files before synthesis to automate tasks such as updating version registers.
   * Free and open source under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Getting Started
```
  # Clone the ChipTools repository to your system:
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pabennett/chiptools.git
  
  # Install using the setup.py script provided in the root directory:
  $ cd chiptools
  $ python setup.py install
  
  # Start the ChipTools command line interface:
  $ cd examples/max_hold
  $ chiptools
  
  # Load the example project:
  (cmd) load_project max_hold.xml
  
  # Run the testsuite using Modelsim:
  (cmd) run_tests modelsim
  
  # ...or Vivado (GHDL and ISIM are also supported):
  (cmd) run_tests vivado
  
  # Synthesise the max_hold component in the lib_max_hold library (ISE, Vivado and Quartus are supported)
  (cmd) synthesise lib_max_hold.max_hold
```
Refer to the [documentation](http://chiptools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/max_hold.html) for examples on using ChipTools to simulate and build FPGA designs.
